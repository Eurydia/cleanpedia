title: "Defining a Function"
last revision: 18 JUNE 2023

A simple function definition consists of one function implementation.
A function can be defined with multiple function implementations as well.

Implementations of a function have to follow specific rules.
If not, the definition of function is invalid, and results in a compile-time error.

Optionally, a function definition can be explicitly typed.
